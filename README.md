# Setup

*A very WIP setup...*

Very inspired from [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon/setup) (a lot of copy-paste here), these guides provide installation instructions to prepare your computer to work with Ruby on Rails applications. In the end, the following tools will be installed:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (default Ruby version: 3.0.3)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (default Node version: 16.13.1)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Guides

- [macOS](guides/macOS.md)
- [Debian/Ubuntu](guides/debian.md)

## Scripts

One day, maybe.
